            <li>You shall not engage in any screen scraping, web scraping or otherwise collecting or extracting (manually or via automated processes) third party data from the Sites for any purpose.</li>

            <li>The Company may from time to time implement a rounding policy in relation to monies deposited by or cashed-out to members where currency conversion is involved. The effect of this policy shall be that deposit or cash-out amounts in currencies other than US Dollars might be rounded up or down on conversion to or from US Dollars. By way of example only, if according to the exchange rate a 10 EUR deposit is converted by the Company into 13.61 USD then your account will be credited with 14.00 USD.

To the extent that they do not conflict with the terms of the User Agreement, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of such third party electronic payment processors and/or financial institutions.</li>
            <li>In the case we have reasonable suspicion that a fraudulent payment is being made or received, including use of stolen credit cards, or any other fraudulent activity (including any charge-back or other reversal of a payment), we reserve the right to block or terminate a user's account, reverse any pay-out made and recover any winnings. We shall be entitled to inform any relevant authorities or entities (including credit reference agencies) of any payment fraud or otherwise unlawful activity, and may employ collection services to recover payments. However, under no circumstances shall the Company be liable for any unauthorized use of credit cards, irrespective of whether or not the credit cards were reported stolen.</li>
            <li>Our expectation is that our members will deposit in order to actively play with their own funds. On accounts where this does not seem to be the case, we reserve the right to enforce a wagering amount on your deposited funds, before allowing any withdrawal from said account. This wagering amount will be a multiplication of the total deposited funds, which we will specify depending on the case (for example 1 x the deposited amount). We reserve the right to require this wagering to be performed in specific games, and to exclude certain low risk bets or game types, at our discretion.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to charge you fees for handling your deposits and withdrawals to and from your account as may be detailed in the "Cashier" from time to time.</li>

        <p class="border">10. Bonuses</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All promotions, bonuses or special offers are subject to promotion-specific terms and conditions and any complimentary bonus credited to your account must be used in adherence with such terms and conditions. Notwithstanding the modification provisions in Section 2, we reserve the right to withdraw or amend any promotion, bonus or special offer at any time including any terms and conditions thereof.</li>
            <li>In the event that the Company has reasonable suspicion that a user of the Service is abusing or attempting to abuse a bonus, offer or other promotion, or is likely to benefit through abuse or lack of good faith from a gambling policy adopted by the Company, then the Company may, at its sole discretion, deny, withhold or withdraw from any user any bonus, offer or promotion, or rescind any policy with respect to that user, either temporarily or permanently, or terminate that user's access to the Services and/or block that user's account.</li>
            <li>All users of the Services shall be entitled only to one welcome bonus. Members who make their first deposit with the Company or any of its white label partners, and who have or previously had an account with any of the Sites owned or operated by the Company, including both In-House Brands and White Label Brands, shall not be entitled to an additional welcome bonus, unless the Company decides otherwise at its absolute discretion.</li>
            <li>Your account is made up of both Available Funds (those that can be used in any applicable game or withdrawn subject to the Withdrawal Policy and which may also be referred to on the Sites as "Cash Balance" or "Deposit Balance") and Restricted Funds (the total of bonus funds that have not yet met the wagering requirement and any winnings associated with such bonus funds and which may also be referred to on the Sites as "Bonus Balance").</li>
            <li>Please note that your deposit may not reach your account immediately, but may take a number of days until such deposit is processed by your payment processor and reaches your account. Until such time, such deposit shall not be considered as Available Funds.</li>
            <li>If you have both Available Funds and Restricted Funds in your account, the next wager you make will use Available Funds first. Restricted Funds will only be used once your Available Funds balance is zero. The foregoing will not apply to your use of free spins, Free Play, jackpot vouchers, Tournament Tickets, Free Bet Tokens and Profit Boost Tokens, which you can use at any time and if you receive any money transfer from another account with respect to our poker products you will be able to use such funds before Restricted Funds.</li>
            <li>Subject to the bullet point below, if you place a wager on casino games using Restricted Funds only and win you will receive, depending on your chosen account currency, up to a maximum of $500/€500/£500 in winnings. If your winnings exceed $500/€500/£500 you will only receive $500/€500/£500. Such limitation on your winnings shall not apply to verified progressive jackpot winnings derived from Restricted Funds.</li>
            <li>From and inclusive of June 14th, 2021: If you have registered with Bjoy7 casino and you have not successfully made a real money deposit into your account, in the event that you place a wager on casino games using Restricted Funds and win you will receive, depending on your chosen account currency, up to a maximum of $100/€100/£100 in winnings. If your winnings exceed $100/€100/£100 you will only receive $100/€100/£100. Such limitation on your winnings shall not apply to verified progressive jackpot winnings derived from Restricted Funds.</li>
            <li>In addition, if you have registered with Bjoy7 casino, until you successfully make a real money deposit into your account, the maximum amount that will be transferred to your Available Funds balance will be $100/€100/£100, subject to you meeting the relevant wagering requirements.</li>
            <li>The jackpot prizes will not increase as a result of wagers made with restricted funds, free spins, Free Play and jackpot vouchers. Only wagers with Available funds shall increase the jackpot prizes.</li>
            <li>In the event that the Company has reasonable suspicion that you have been taking unfair advantage of the Company's welcome bonuses or have executed any other act in bad faith in relation to a bonus promotion offered on any of the Sites owned and/or operated by the Company, the Company shall have the right to block or terminate your accounts with the Company and in such circumstances, the Company shall be under no obligation to refund to you any funds that may be in your account.</li>
            <li>If we have reasonable suspicion that an account or group of accounts are operating systematically – for example employing specific wagering techniques or wagering as a group, the Company shall have the right to block or terminate all accounts and in such circumstances, the Company shall be under no obligation to refund to you any funds that may be in your account.</li>
            <li>You may request the removal of a bonus from your account, but please be aware that this removal may include any winnings gained from such bonus.</li>
            <li>Please be advised that the 'confirm your ID' bonus is issued at the Company's discretion and therefore may not be available for all members who verify their identity with us. Notwithstanding the modification provisions in Section 2, we reserve the right to remove this bonus offer at any time. Certain criteria will be taken into consideration when determining which members will receive the verification bonus, such as registration country, deposit amount, deposit payment type, and other details of the account.</li>
